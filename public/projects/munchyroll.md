# Munchyroll
Simple and fast anime streaming web app

Oh man, where do I even begin? 

Munchyroll was a project of mine that I've been working on and off on for the past two years. Back during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to use a Chromebook laptop issued by my school, which had tons of restrictions on it. 

So a bright idea of mine was to try and use an API that was unrestricted on the school protocols to feed me anime video URLs, and then all I had to do was make a nice frontend for it.

On April 19, 2021, I finalized what I called "The First Munchyroll"

###### (Epic design, huh?)
I used this website so much, because the feeling of accessing content that would otherwise be restricted on my school's internet protocols was suddenly available to me and other people I shared the website with.

However, as the year progressed into the next school year, I found myself watching less and less anime and not even coding that much anime. As such, the sources the API would scrape data from got taken down and suddenly there was no more data being fed to the website. So, The First Munchyroll was now broken forever.

Fast forward to April 2022, where I've just gotten out of another school year. I'm now bored with nothing to do in life besides cry about my average grades and reminisce about the past when life was so much better. Wait a minute. Life was so much better watching anime on my borderline illegal anime web app, right?? So I should try and fix the old one, I thought

I went a whole year without coding or touching anything code related, so I took one look at my code, and I was like, "What the heck is this mess of code?"

I scrapped The First Munchyroll and began development on The Second Munchyroll.

I had made this with React and used a third party API to get anime info and data. On this project, I had focused on the frontend, and I would often make minor tweaks every day from things like button sizes, background color choices, and the colors and fonts of certain things. I had discovered the [Lighthouse](https://web.dev) website grader, which grades your website and evaluates how fast it loads and how compatible it works with different screen sizes.

 I tried very hard to achieve a score of 100, which is very hard to get. I ended up getting around a low 90, which I thought was a decent job for someone who didn't touch Visual Studio Code for over a year.

Fast forward to the end of the summer of 2022. I'm approaching a new school year and dreading AP Chemistry (PS: Did not end well). I am forced to (yet again) drop watching anime until 4am every night and start attempting to be a tryhard at school again. As a result, I don't touch Munchyroll over this next school year either. However, not as much as I didn't for The First Munchyroll, I still made the most weirdest commits on it as I would get bored and just randomly change the entire site's color scheme sometimes.

Another year has passed. It's now April 2023. I open The Second Munchyroll, and to my surprise, I see what you saw in the image above of The Second Munchyroll. What happened? Technically the same thing that happened to The First Munchyroll. You see, the source that I was getting data from started implementing a "scrape shield," which prevents people like me from harvesting data from their advertisement filled websites. I couldn't figure out a way to work around it, so The Second Munchyroll came to an end.

Instead of studying for finals, why don't we create a new anime streaming website? Good idea, right?? Right???

Yeah, so I started developing The Third Munchyroll.

This is the most current version, and I learned from my mistakes from the last two Munchyrolls to bring a (hopefully) better Munchyroll.

Thank you for reading my story about Munchyroll!
