Crypto Comparer is a web app written in Flask to compare historical prices of two cryptocurrencies using the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to get the price information and the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library to display data in a simple format. 

Me and my team members ([RohanP1506](https://github.com/RohanP1506) and [Jacobw0410](https://github.com/Jacobw0410)) created this project for a high school STEM related competition hosted by a club called the Technical Student Association (TSA). We were all introductory computer science students at the time, and this was our first real project outside of class. 

Some problems we ran into was taking care of ourselves while working. There was one time we worked for 7 hours in a row through the project face to face. We did this twice on consecutive Saturdays. While a bit mentally and physically exhausting, we were all proud at what we had done and how long it had took us to complete the task.

Something I'd take away from this project would be that I definitely have to do more research on APIs and come prepared knowing how to do simple functions as I kept having to refer to the Python and [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) documentations.
