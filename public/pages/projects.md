# My Projects
Here's a list of some of my projects that I've made or am working on in my free time!

## Jeydin21's Blog - [Demo](/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Jeydin21/blog)
A blog I made in React that uses Markdown files to display content on the page

Since I've been slowly learning how to use Markdown to take notes in class I wanted to try to make a website from Markdown

## Calculator App - [Demo](https://calc.j21.dev) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Jeydin21/Calculator-App)
A web app made with HTML, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and JavaScript to bring users a functioning calculator that has dark and light mode support, as well as mobile responsiveness

I made this project mainly to practice using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) more, as I feel like it's something that I should become knowledgeable in
